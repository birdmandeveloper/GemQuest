# GemQuest
RPG Game Developed in Java
Protagonists Lewis, Clark, and Tamatha embark on a mission to find a mystical stone, a beacon of hope for impoverished people worldwide.
SETTING DESCRIPTION-----So we can have them start in a town and talking to NPCS which you have free direction to create or you could just make one NPC class and clone it with varying randomize behaviors.---- they transition to a more free range/unexplored territory, we can think of a cool name of the unexlored lands but thats where random enemy encounters happen. Basically a rural environment that has human presence and one that doesn't for first setting.


Encounter surreal challenges. The first chapter will have specific enemies. Sin Hugs, Sun Hugs, And Tech mogul extraordinaire- this is 3 enemy assets to design.

Introduction of antagonist Nazar, armed with a stopwatch freezing time, adding a layer of complexity to their obstacles- we don't need to have him as the boss of world 1. the boss can just be the Junior Developer, but after we beat the developer there needs to be a cutscene basically generated with UI so you do want to have the character Asset for Nazar made.

Discovery of godsend girl Tamatha, possessing unique abilities, intensifying the intrigue of their quest and introducing magic.


BATTLE SYSTEM: Turn Based. Either use physical move or cursed technique, items in your equip slot as well such as OBJ_Boots.

Example of battle system stats---------------

Tech mogul extraordinaire stats——


Random enemy encounter sequence

Base attack: 10

You should be able to achieve all of this with 1-3 NPC you clone, 1 Player, 4 Enemies including Nazar, probably ~6 background tiles to match described setting, buildings can be either a solid tile or an object.
