# GemQuest
RPG Game Developed in Java
Protagonists Lewis, Clark, and Tamatha embark on a mission to find a mystical stone, a beacon of hope for impoverished people worldwide.|

# CHAPTER ONE-

In this intricate tale, three young adventurers—Lewis, Clark, and Tamatha—embark on a quest to locate a mystical stone that embodies the aspirations of the impoverished across the globe. Their journey takes them from Yorkshire to Germany and eventually to Australia, where they face numerous challenges and adversaries.

Along their way, they encounter a helpful girl named Tamatha, who possesses healing abilities. Tamatha guides them to a powerful witch in Germany, who not only aids their physical wounds but also grants them magical powers. Lewis learns how to shapeshift, while Tamatha enhances her fiery skills. Clark gains the ability to heal others. With their newfound abilities, the trio becomes a formidable force.

However, their journey is far from easy. They face a man with a stopwatch who can freeze time, creating obstacles such as a maze of corn and powerful enemies. Despite their resilience, they are repeatedly bested by this mysterious man, who eventually absorbs their companions one by one. First, Papagayo sacrifices himself, then Clark is cast into another dimension, leaving only Tamatha and Lewis.

In a climactic battle, Tamatha bravely attacks the magical gem, but her efforts prove futile. She is tragically disintegrated, leaving behind only the player as the last remaining hope. The gem then splits into ten pieces, destroying Tamborine Mountain in the process, to evade any potential thieves.

The fate of the world now hangs in the balance, with the player left to determine the outcome of this epic tale. Will they pursue the scattered pieces of the gem, or will a new adventure unfold in the wake of this monumental event?

# SETTING DESCRIPTION-----
So we can have them start in a town and talking to NPCS which you have free direction to create or you could just make one NPC class and clone it with varying randomize behaviors.---- they transition to a more free range/unexplored territory, we can think of a cool name of the unexlored lands but thats where random enemy encounters happen. Basically a rural environment that has human presence and one that doesn't for first setting.


Encounter surreal challenges. The first chapter will have specific enemies. Sin Hugs, Sun Hugs, And Tech mogul extraordinaire- this is 3 enemy assets to design.

Introduction of antagonist Nazar, armed with a stopwatch freezing time, adding a layer of complexity to their obstacles- we don't need to have him as the boss of world 1. the boss can just be the Junior Developer, but after we beat the developer there needs to be a cutscene basically generated with UI so you do want to have the character Asset for Nazar made.

Discovery of godsend girl Tamatha, possessing unique abilities, intensifying the intrigue of their quest and introducing magic.
